This script automates the process of scraping emails from Instagram bios using Selenium

üîπ How the Script Works
1Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up WebDriver & Load Environment Variables
Installs and configures Selenium with Chrome WebDriver.
Uses a .env file to securely store Instagram login credentials.
Reads Instagram profile URLs from an Excel file (urls.xlsx).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Log in to Instagram
Opens Instagram and waits for the login page to load.
Enters the stored username and password.
Clicks the login button and waits for authentication.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Visit Each Profile & Extract Emails
Goes to each Instagram profile URL.
Waits for the page to load fully.
Extracts the bio content using a CSS selector.
Uses a regular expression (regex) to find email addresses inside the bio.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Save Emails to an Excel File
Stores the extracted email along with the profile URL.
Saves progress to an Excel file (emails_extracted.xlsx) after each processed profile.
Implements error handling and resume capability (skips previously processed URLs).
5Ô∏è‚É£ Error Handling & Final Cleanup
Implements a retry mechanism in case of permission errors while saving Excel.
Ensures the browser (driver.quit()) is closed when done.
üîπ Why This Approach?
Headless Mode: Runs without opening the browser, making it faster.
Wait for Elements: Uses explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before interaction.
Regex for Emails: Captures valid email formats efficiently.
Resume Functionality: Prevents duplicate processing if the script is interrupted.
Excel Storage: Saves extracted emails in an organized, readable format.
